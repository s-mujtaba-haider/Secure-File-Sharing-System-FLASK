# Secure-File-Sharing-System-FLASK
This project aims to create a secure, web-based file-sharing platform that prioritizes data privacy. Files uploaded to the system are encrypted on the client side before they reach the server, ensuring the server never has access to the unencrypted content. When a recipient downloads a file, they will decrypt it on their own system.
